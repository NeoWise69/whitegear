## <b>For developers</b>

### + What IDE should I use to develop for this codebase?

#### Answer:

Main and strongly recommended IDE was and always will be <b>JetBrains CLion</b>


### + How to make a changes in certain engine module (i.e. in core module)?

#### TL;DR: 
    1 - Switch to target branch or if it doesn't exist yet, create one; 
    2 - Make your changes there;
    3 - Commit it;
    4 - Merge it into MAIN

#### Answer:

Every time you'll need to make a changes in engine codebase, firstly you
need to decide <b><i>on what part of the engine this changes will be?</i></b>
Usually all changes and the whole engine codebase is split into something called
<b>module</b>. It's required to have a separate branch for every 'module'. This
means that if your changes is up to already existing codebase's module, the only
thing you'll need is to switch current branch to chosen one. If this changes requires
to create new module, then you should to create the new branch firstly. When your
changes are ready, the only thing you'll need to do is to merge this branch into 'main'
branch.
